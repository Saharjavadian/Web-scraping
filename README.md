# Web-scraping
Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites and online platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and others. Python offers powerful libraries (like requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium) that can automate the data collection process.
However, each website has its own terms of service, and scraping is often restricted or prohibitedâ€”especially for platforms like Facebook or Instagram, which require authentication or API access.
Some websites, such as Quotes to Scrape (http://quotes.toscrape.com), are openly available for scraping and do not require an API. For platforms that do require API access, you'll typically need to create an account and register for API keys to access their data legally and securely.
